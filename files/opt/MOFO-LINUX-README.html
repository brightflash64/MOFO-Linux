<h2>Release Date:  02/08/2018.</h2></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>MOFO Linux is an operating system optimized for defeating all major
methods of internet censorship and surveillance used by governments, 
corporations, schools, and internet service providers. It is a tool
created to empower people for exercising their unalienable <b>
rights to privacy, freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly</b>, in accordance with
the <a href="file:///usr/local/share/html/iccpr.html">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>
and the <a href="file:///usr/local/share/html/udhr.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.
The system contains office, multimedia, and internet applications enabling you to read, write, watch,
or listen to any media from anywhere with an internet connection. MOFO Linux is designed to unblock
everything.
</p>

<p>MOFO Linux is designed for easy usage on home PCs, laptops, and any computers installed in internet
cafes around the world.  Use MOFO Linux to break free of authoritarian powers intending to control the
flow of information or "own the truth."  MOFO Linux is built upon an Ubuntu base,
with plenty of the latest software for <a href="file:///usr/local/share/html/browsing.html"> web browsing</a>,
productivity and entertainment.
</p>

<p>MOFO Linux contains Encrypted DNS, OpenVPN, Softether, Tor, Freenet, and I2P, and other
software tools provide anonymous and secure access to the internet and circumvention of state
censorship restrictions.  The system is designed for running from a bootable USB stick or "frugal
install" on a hard drive / SSD. Browsing history and usage tracks are destroyed on shutdown.
</p>

<p>MOFO Linux can be installed to a hard drive, flash memory device, or SSD in the manner
of any other Linux distribution.  Use the Startup Disk Creator to make a bootable live USB system.
When running as a live USB or live DVD, changes and usage tracks are lost on shutdown.
Otherwise, use Ubiquity to install MOFO Linux to a hard drive or flash memory device with at least
8 GB of space.  Changes are persistent in a fully installed system, so be sure to make liberal use
of file encryption and disk wiping applications installed in MOFO Linux.
</p>

<h3>SYSTEM PASSWORDS</h3>
<p>MOFO Linux is configured with one default user account (mofo), with the
ability to switch to root.  There are no passwords in the default MOFO Linux distro.  You may create
your own password, if desired, but it is not necessary for typical usage.
</p>

<h3>LANTERN and PSIPHON (Domain Fronting Proxies)</h3>
<p><a href="https://getlantern.org" target="_blank">Lantern</a> works well in restricted internet
environments. Simply find "Lantern" in the Dash application search (the top icon on the desktop launcher).
Start Lantern and it will automatically connect to remote servers and provide fast, unrestricted internet
access through Firefox.
</p>
<p><a href="https://psiphon.ca" target="_blank">Psiphon</a> is a circumvention system effective against
sophisticated state censorship stystems.  Access psiphon in the Dash application search, and click to bring
up the controller.  Select "start" or "stop" as necessary, and the controller will handle the configuration
process.
</p>

<h3>OPENVPN IS WELL SUPPORTED IN MOFO LINUX</h3>
<p>To use an Open VPN service with MOFO Linux, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you don't have a subscription to a VPN service, simply use the free servers at 
<a href="http://vpngate.net" target="_blank">http://vpngate.net</a>.  If VPN Gate is 
blocked in your country, try the mirrors listed below to obtain fresh OpenVPN config files.
If OpenVPN is blocked, use Bitmask, Lantern, Psiphon, or Tor Browser to unblock your internet.
</li>

<li>Keep a copy of your ovpn, key, ca, and crt files on a USB flashdrive
or SD card.  After starting MOFO Linux, use the OpenVPN Controller application
to locate and open the desired ovpn file.  For convenience, the files may be copied
to the "openvpn" folder in the home directory.  If using <a href="http://vpngate.net">VPNGate</a>,
be aware that the keys and certificate data are contained within one ovpn file.
</li>

<li>NetworkManager can also manage OpenVPN connections.  Right click the networking icon
and follow the menu prompts for creating a new server connection. The NetworkManager
applet will not work with the VPNGate "single ovpn" files, which contain the certificate
and key data.  Again, use the OpenVPN Controller application for servers operated by VPNGate
volunteers.
</li>

<li><a href="https://leap.se" target="_blank">Bitmask</a> is an effective but user friendly service
which uses obfuscated OpenVPN.  It is fantastic - automatically managing server selection,
encrypting the connection, and other tasks.  Bitmask now offers encrypted email services.  It is known to
effectively circumvent the Great Firewall of China!  Start Bitmask by clicking its icon on the launcher.  Also,
stop DNSCrypt-proxy while using Bitmask due to incompatibility.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>SOFTETHER VPN</h3>
<p>Softether is capable of fast broadband data transfers, uses strong encryption, but is highly
targeted by censorship authorities.  Client software for Linux is still sparse, but MOFO Linux
includes the official client plus a Softether Controller application which will partially automate
the connection process.
</p>

<h3>TOR, I2P, FREENET, and CJDNS DARKNET / ANONYMOUS NETWORKING</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.torproject.org" target="_blank">Tor</a> is the oldest and most well developed anonymous
network, with extensive infrastructure providing strong anonymity to internet users.
<a href="https://geti2p.net" target="_blank">I2P</a> is a new robust privacy and anonymity network.
It contains quite a lot of content and services for its users, all resistant to surveillance and
censorship.  <a href="https://freenetproject.org/" target="_blank">Freenet</a> is an active, decentralised
anonymous network designed such that it is impossible to censor and extremely resistant to surveillance.
These networks contain internally reachable anonymized websites, chat areas, forums, markets, and exit nodes to
the open internet.
</p>

<p>
For anonymous web browsing, use the "Tor Browser" application, found on the launcher or by entering "Tor" in
the Dash search field.  The Tor Browser, Tor Messenger, and OnionShare applications are fully configured for
routing through Tor.  If you are in China or other countries which block encryption, use the Tor bridges to 
defeat the blockage.  Meek-Azure and Obfs4 are most effective.  Tor, with Obfs4 or Scramblesuit, may also be
run separately using the  "Tor Controller" application.  Use the same application to shut down Tor and reconfigure
Firefox for normal browsing.
</p>

<p>
For I2P, use the "I2P Controller" application, found by entering "I2P" in the Dash search field.  Use the same
application to shut down I2P and reconfigure Firefox for normal browsing.
</p>

<p>In MOFO Linux, Freenet is configured to install freshly from its java package.  Use the "Freenet
Installer" application to set it up for the first time.  To stop or restart Freenet, use the buttons within
its main browser page.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns" target="_blank">Cjdns</a> is a global,
decentralised, encrypted mesh networking protocol.
<a href="https://hyperboria.net" target="_blank">Hyperboria</a> is the largest of
many networks using cjdns offering a vast volume of cyberspace separate from the
main internet.  It is decentralised and extremely difficult to surveil or censor.
</p>

<h3>INTERPLANETARY FILE SYSTEM</h3>
<p>The Interplanetary File System is technology providing a robust, decentralised internet based on content
instead of location.  Applications and data on IPFS are permanent and distributed - with no single point
of failure or vulnerability to censorship.  Media files, databases, websites, archives on IPFS can
exist with resilliance and be accessed with high speed.
</p>

<h3>FILE SYSTEM ENCRYPTION: VERACRYPT, ZULUCRYPT, and ECRYPTFS</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com" target="_blank">Veracrypt</a> is the
top multi-platform software for VERY STRONG file system encryption forked from Truecrypt.
It has great features and performance - able to encrypt drives and directories, even
hiding them from detection. It is compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac systems, so
encrypted files may be created or accessed on just about any computer.
<a href="https://mhogomchungu.github.io/zuluCrypt/" target="_blank">Zulucrypt</a> is a native
Linux application for file and volume encryption also forked from Truecrypt.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://ecryptfs.org" target="_blank">Ecryptfs</a> is an encrypted filesystem with
support built into the Linux Kernel.  It is fast, strong, and efficient enough to keep users'
files safe from unwanted access.  Use it to encrypt folders or whole drives which will hold
sensitive data.  Ecryptfs is the principal means of encrypting the home directory and other
storage volumes in Linux.
</p>

<p>It is suggested that users run MOFO Linux from a flash drive and keep a separate
flashdrive partition for encrypted files.  Another option is to use a separate drive
and encrypt its entire contents, accessing it through Veracrypt.  Doing that, it is possible
to carry a large volume of data which is quite difficult to detect and even more difficult
to decrypt.  In theory, a well-arranged encrypted volume should be secure for centuries.
Be careful to create strong passwords.  Do not allow any secret keys to be compromised.
</p>

<h3>MULTMEDIA with ENHANCED AUDIO</h3>
<p><a href="https://kodi.tv" target="_blank">Kodi Media Center</a> provides access to thousands
of high quality video and audio streams from around the world. The very good Ubuntu multimedia
apps are enhanced by the <a href="https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects" target="_blank">PulseEffects</a>
with systemwide audio equalization, compression, and limiting for extra punch in home theater / office
presentation environments.
</p>

<h3>ENGLISH, ARABIC, AND CHINESE LANGUAGE SUPPORT</h3>
<p>MOFO Linux defaults to English on startup, with ability to change the system to Chinese or Arabic in the
Settings application.  Multilanguage keyboard input is always available.  To change the system language,
select it in "Language support", then <b>LOG OUT</b> and 
<b>LOG BACK IN</b> without turning off the computer.  The new language will then be activated. Language
support in Firefox may be managed by using the <i>Tools -> Addons -> Languages</i> menu.
</p>

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
<p>MOFO Linux wishes to acknowledge and thank the developers creating
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu Linux</a>, the
base system upon which MOFO Linux is built.  Ubuntu provides incredibly smooth operation,
fast perfomance, and a pleasant user interface quite suitable for building customized
systems.  The developers of the many cryptographic / VPN systems used by MOFO Linux
get a nod too!  Without OpenVPN, Tor, RSA, SSL, and other goodies, the world would be
a much less free and more dangerous place.
</p>
