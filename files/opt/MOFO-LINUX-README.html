<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>MOFO Linux is an operating system optimized for defeating all major
methods of internet censorship and surveillance used by governments, 
corporations, schools, and internet service providers. It is a tool
created to empower people for exercising their inalienable <b>
rights to privacy, freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly</b>, in accordance with
the <a href="file:///opt/html/iccpr.html">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>
and the <a href="file:///opt/html/udhr.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>.
The system contains office, multimedia, and internet applications enabling you to read, write, watch,
or listen to any media from anywhere with an internet connection.
</p>

<p>MOFO Linux is designed for easy usage on home PCs, laptops, and any 
computers installed in internet cafes around the world.  Use MOFO Linux
to break free of authoritarian powers intending to control the flow
of information or "own the truth."  As of version 4.0, MOFO Linux is
built upon an Ubuntu base, with all of the latest software for productivity
and entertainment.
</p>

<p>MOFO Linux has Encrypted DNS, OpenVPN, Softether, Tor, and I2P installed
to provide anonymous and secure access to the internet.  The system is designed
for running from a bootable USB stick or "frugal install" on a hard drive / SSD.
Browsing history and usage tracks are destroyed on shutdown.
</p>

<p>MOFO Linux can be installed to a hard drive, flash memory device, or SSD in the manner
of any other Ubuntu distribution.  Use the included installation utility to install to a
storage device with at least 8 GB of space.  Changes are persistent in a fully installed
system, so be sure to make liberal use of file encryption and clean-up applications installed
in MOFO Linux.
</p>

<h3>SYSTEM PASSWORDS</h3>
<p>As of version 4.0, MOFO Linux is configured with one default user account (mofo), with the
ability to switch to root.  There are no passwords in the default MOFO Linux distro.  You may create
your own password, if desired, but it is not necessary for typical usage.
</p>

<h3>L2TP/IPsec VPN IN MOFO LINUX</h3>
<p>Due to the removal of Openswan and dependencies from the Ubuntu repositories,
L2TP/IPSec is not an available VPN.  Strongswan is installed, providing IPSEC VPN
connectivity.
</p>

<h3>SOFTETHER VPN</h3>
<p>Softether is capable of fast broadband data transfers, uses strong encryption, but is highly
targeted by censorship authorities.  Client software for Linux is still sparse, but MOFO Linux
includes the official client with connectivity through manually entered shell commands.
</p>

<h3>LANTERN (Domain Fronting Proxy)</h3>
<p><a href="https://getlantern.org" target="_blank">Lantern</a> works well in restricted internet
environments. Simply find "Lantern" in the Dash application search (the top icon on the desktop launcher).
Start Lantern and it will automatically connect to remote servers and provide fast, unrestricted internet
access through Firefox.
</p>

<h3>OPENVPN IS WELL SUPPORTED IN MOFO LINUX</h3>
<p>To use an Open VPN service with MOFO Linux, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you don't have a subscription to a VPN service, simply use the free servers at 
<a href="http://vpngate.net" target="_blank">http://vpngate.net</a>.  If VPN Gate is 
blocked in your country, try the mirrors listed below to obtain fresh OpenVPN config files.
</li>

<li>Keep a copy of your ovpn, key, ca, and crt files on a USB flashdrive
or SD card.  After starting MOFO Linux, use the OpenVPN Controller application
to locate and open the desired ovpn file.  For convenience, the files may be copied
to the "openvpn" folder in the home directory.  If using <a href="http://vpngate.net">VPNGate</a>,
be aware that the keys and certificate data are contained within one ovpn file.
</li>

<li>NetworkManager can also manage OpenVPN connections.  Right click the networking icon
and follow the menu prompts for creating a new server connection. The NetworkManager
applet will not work with the VPNGate "single ovpn" files, which contain the certificate
and key data.  Again, use the OpenVPN Controller application for servers operated by VPNGate
volunteers.
</li>

<li><a href="https://leap.se" target="_blank">Bitmask</a> is a new and potentially superior option
which uses obfuscation with OpenVPN.  It is fantastic - managing server selection, encrypting the connection,
and other tasks automatically.  Bitmask now offers encrypted email services.  It is known to
effectively circumvent the Great Firewall of China!  Start Bitmask by clicking its icon on the launcher.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TOR, I2P, CJDNS ANONYMOUS NETWORKING / DARKNET</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://geti2p.net" target="_blank">I2P</a> is a new robust privacy and anonymity network.
It is configured as a proxy, but does several other complex tasks to conceal identity and browsing activity.
<a href="https://www.torproject.org" target="_blank">Tor</a> is an older network,
with a well developed infrastructure providing anonymity to internet users. For Tor, use the
"Tor Browser" application, found on the launcher or by entering "Tor" in the Dash search field.  For
I2P, use the "I2P Controller" application, found by entering "I2P" in the Dash search field.  These
networks contain internally reachable, anonymized sites as well as exit nodes to the open internet.
</p>

<p>
The Tor Browser, Tor Messenger, and OnionShare applications are fully configured for routing through Tor.
If you are in China or other countries which block encryption, use the Tor bridges and pluggable transports
to defeat the blockage.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns" target="_blank">Cjdns</a> is a global,
decentralised, encrypted mesh networking protocol.
<a href="https://hyperboria.net" target="_blank">Hyperboria</a> is the largest of
many networks using cjdns offering a vast volume of cyberspace separate from the
main internet.  It is extremely difficult to surveil or censor.
</p>

<br>
<h3>FILE SYSTEM ENCRYPTION: VERACRYPT, ZULUCRYPT, and ECRYPTFS</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com" target="_blank">Veracrypt</a> is the
top multi-platform software for VERY STRONG file system encryption forked from Truecrypt.
It has great features and performance - able to encrypt drives and directories, even
hiding them from detection. It is compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac systems, so
encrypted files may be created or accessed on just about any computer.
<a href="https://mhogomchungu.github.io/zuluCrypt/" target="_blank">Zulucrypt</a> is a native
Linux application for file and volume encryption also forked from Truecrypt.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://ecryptfs.org" target="_blank">Ecryptfs</a> is an encrypted filesystem with
support built into the Linux Kernel.  It is fast, strong, and efficient enough to keep users'
files safe from unwanted access.  Use it to encrypt folders or whole drives which will hold
sensitive data.  Ecryptfs is the principal means of encrypting the home directory and other
storage volumes in Linux.
</p>

<p>It is suggested that users run MOFO Linux from a flash drive and keep a separate
flashdrive partition for encrypted files.  Another option is to use a separate drive
and encrypt its entire contents, accessing it through Veracrypt.  Doing that, it is possible
to carry a large volume of data which is quite difficult to detect and even more difficult
to decrypt.  In theory, a well-arranged encrypted volume should be secure for centuries.
Be careful to create strong passwords.  Do not allow any secret keys to be compromised.
</p>

<h3>MULTMEDIA with ENHANCED AUDIO</h3>
<p>The very good Ubuntu multimedia apps are enhanced with built-in audio equalization,
compression, and limiting for extra punch in home theater / office presentation
environments.  Extra radio stations have been added to Rhythmbox for access to
news, music, and political programming.
</p>

<h3>ENGLISH, ARABIC, AND CHINESE LANGUAGE SUPPORT</h3>

<p>MOFO Linux 4.0 and above continues with language options introduced in MOFO Linux 3.0.
MOFO defaults to English on startup, but Chinese and Arabic system languages may
be selected from the Settings application.  Multilanguage keyboard input is always available.
To change the system language, select it in "Language support", then <b>LOG OUT</b> and 
<b>LOG BACK IN</b> without turning off the computer.  The new language will then be activated.
</p>

<p>
Firefox may be switched between Chinese, Arabic, or English languages at any time by
using the <i>Tools -> Languages</i> menu.
</p>

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>

<p>MOFO Linux wishes to acknowledge and thank the developers creating
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu Linux</a>, the
base system upon which MOFO Linux is built.  Ubuntu provides incredibly smooth operation,
fast perfomance, and a pleasant user interface quite suitable for building customized
systems.  The developers of the many cryptographic / VPN systems used by MOFO Linux
get a nod too!  Without OpenVPN, Tor, RSA, SSL, and other goodies, the world would be
a much less free and more dangerous place.
</p>
