<h1>Web Browsing in MOFO Linux</h1>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>MOFO Linux offers multiple ways to browse the internet while circumventing
censorship barriers.  There are, however, access priorities and
performance trades to consider. We will explore some of the main factors in the
paragraphs below.
</p>

<p>The two main considerations for internet browsing in MOFO Linux are anonymity
and connection bandwidth.  One can have high anonymity but get content at a lower
speed, or browse with faster speed and have less anonymity and greater exposure to
censorship.
</p>

<p>Firefox, with Lantern or Psiphon domain fronting proxies, is the primary
means of accessing web content in MOFO Linux.  Starting either proxy method will
bring up Firefox and make the necessary network connections to circumvent
censorship barriers.  Both provide good broadband connectivity and use moderate
encryption to thwart moderate surveillance and deep packet inspection.  State level
attackers have the means to time, capture, and eventually decrypt traffic
through these proxies, so they should be considered <i>access</i> and not
<i>anonymity</i> tools.  These circumvention tools rely on relaying
browser traffic through domains that are financially harmful for the
censoring government to block.  Thus, they work most of the time, with only
intermittent interruption.
</p>

<p>Kodi Media Center, while not a web browser per se, does use the web to access
much of its content.  State censorship systems can (and do) impair the ability to
find and stream content in Kodi, so it is configured in MOFO Linux to use the same
circumvention methods as Firefox.  Streaming bandwidth is lower than when connecting
directly to a content source, but the content <i>is</i> unblocked.
</p>

<p>OpenVPN and SoftEther provide high bandwidth and secure access to
remote VPN severs.  These currently have the significant disadvantage of
being easily detected and blocked by censoring countries.  Without using
extra obfuscation methods, do not expect OpenVPN or SoftEther to work
in countries such as China or Iran.
</p>

<p>Tor Browser is the primary tool for anonymous web access in MOFO Linux.  It
uses a system of 
<a href="https://obfuscation.github.io/" target="_blank">pluggable transports</a>
for obfuscation and onion routing which greatly increases the difficulty for an
attacker to determine user's IP address. Tor Browser uses a separate instance of
Firefox, specially configured and hardened, to access the internet.  There is some
latency on the network of Tor relays, so streaming content is slower than on Psiphon
or Lantern, but Tor provides both strong anonymity and resistance to blocking. Tor
Browser also provides access to hidden services only accessible through Tor relays.
</p>

<p>Note that MOFO Linux contains an installation of Tor separate from the one in
Tor Browser.  It is available through the Tor Controller application and must
be used with Obfs4 or Scramblesuit pluggable transports.  Tor Controller will
configure Firefox to use Tor instead of Lantern or Psiphon.
</p>
 
</p>I2P and Freenet are the other darknet applications, other than Tor,
in MOFO Linux.  These provide access to their own respective content, and
because of encryption and network relays, I2P and Freenet offer anonymity
and redistance to censorship.
